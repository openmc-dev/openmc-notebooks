    "# Multigroup Cross Section Generation Part II: Advanced Features\n",
    "This IPython Notebook illustrates the use of the `openmc.mgxs` module to calculate multi-group cross sections for a heterogeneous fuel pin cell geometry. In particular, this Notebook illustrates the following features:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creation of multi-group cross sections on a **heterogeneous geometry**\n",
    "* Calculation of cross sections on a **nuclide-by-nuclide basis**\n",
    "* The use of **[tally precision triggers](../io_formats/settings.rst#trigger-element)** with multi-group cross sections\n",
    "* Built-in features for **energy condensation** in downstream data processing\n",
    "* The use of the **`openmc.data`** module to plot continuous-energy vs. multi-group cross sections\n",
    "* **Validation** of multi-group cross sections with **[OpenMOC](https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/)**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** This Notebook was created using [OpenMOC](https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/) to verify the multi-group cross-sections generated by OpenMC. You must install [OpenMOC](https://mit-crpg.github.io/OpenMOC/) on your system in order to run this Notebook in its entirety. In addition, this Notebook illustrates the use of [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) `DataFrames` to containerize multi-group cross section data."
